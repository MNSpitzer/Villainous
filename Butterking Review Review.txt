Overall Concept:
A head from one custom spinoff reviewing the other custom spinoff always struck me as kinda iffy. It smells like bias. This isn't as bad as the PiraVil teaser preview, as this one at least has an actual product. That makes this by the best Butterking review of PiraVil so far. Good improvement!
5/10

Medium:
This one isn't terrible, but it's also not great. It misses some key points, but at least tries to be fair. Not Butterking's worst custom review, not his best either.
6/10

Best:
I actually find myself agreeing with a lot of this. Still some small mistakes to be ironed out, but overall good execution of a review. Easily the best review here.
8/10

Worst:
This one doesn't come together and seems to misunderstand PiraVil's audience. I'd love to rank this higher because of the X joke, but it's just not very substantial. Sadly the worst of the reviews here.
3/10

Similar but better than bad one:
Suffers from the same problem as the X review, it just glances over the content and then makes a judgement. It's not as bad as X's review, though. Meh.
5/10

Overall nice with one problem:
This one has some nice parts but then drags it down with the X remark. That just makes it seem Y. Still overall solid review. If I had to improve it, I'd leave out X.
6/10

Terrible:
I love the idea of this one. The X idea for a review is clever. The execution, not so much. You mostly read it and it seems like he's shitting on everything. Almost the worst review, but Y takes the cake. Needs serious looking at.
3.5/10
